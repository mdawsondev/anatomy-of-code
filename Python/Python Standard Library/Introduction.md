# Introduction

The "Python library" contains a number of different components, from data types that would be considered part of the "core" of a language to built-in functions and exceptions that can be called by Python without the need for an `import` statement.

The bulk of the library consists of a collection of modules. Some are written in C and built into the Python interpreter, while others are written in Python and imported in source form. Some provide highly-specific language features to python while others offer interfacing with certain OS and hardware.

The Python Standard Library is organized in a way that describes built-in functions, data, exceptions, and finally modules grouped in chapters of related content.

_Aside: The introduction mentions this can be read in any way desired, but I'll probably take notes on it in order._
