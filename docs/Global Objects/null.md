# null
###### Sourced through [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null).

The value `null` prepresents the **intentional absense** of any object value, and is a primitive value.

### Syntax
```
null
```

### Description
`null` is written with a literal: `null`, and is not an indentifer for a property of the global object. `null` represents a lack of identification indicating that a variable points to no object and was **intended** to do so.

`null` and `undefined` differ in that `null` is **explicitly defined** by the developer, while `undefined` represents any variable that has not been set within the present scope. Likened to a discussion, `null` would be "`null` is nothing," and `undefined` would be "I have no idea what `undefined` is."
