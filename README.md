# Anatomy of Code

Anatomy of Code houses my disection and analysis of various programming language docs. Originally, this repo housed my interest in pulling apart the [MDN JavaScript docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), but I realized this was something I'd likely be doing for several languages or technologies.

The content here was typed character by character, never copied. Although _some_ information may be transcribed as the original was written, the majority of it was rephrased and summarized to help ensure I understand what was being read. The odds of this repository being useful to anyone but myself are slim, but if you find yourself reading this and my notes help you understand some issues more easily then you're welcome to use anything here as you see fit.

Referenced will be listed in their respective documents.
