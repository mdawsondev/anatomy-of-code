# Anatomy of JavaScript

Anatomy of JavaScript is my personal notebook archiving my dissection of the JavaScript language. This repo is neither a reference library nor a transcription of the original documents it sources; it was only meant to help me ensure I understood the language as thoroughly as possible. If you want to clone or fork this project, you're more than welcome to - however, I'd like to encourage you to start from the ground up like I have if you want to get the most out of the experience.

Sources for reference will be listed in their appropriate documents.
